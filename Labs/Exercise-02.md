# Lab 02: Building and Customizing Prompt Flows

#### Estimated Duration: 90 Minutes

## Overview

In this lab, you will gain hands-on experience in initializing a Prompt Flow project in Microsoft Foundry, setting up the necessary environment to begin developing, testing, and refining AI applications. You will create and customize prompts within Microsoft Foundry's Prompt Flow. Starting with the creation of a new flow, you will add and configure the Prompt tool and develop a flow incorporating LLM (Large Language Model) and Prompt tools. By authoring a sample flow and running it with custom inputs, you'll learn how to monitor flow execution and evaluate outputs, thereby understanding the practical steps involved in developing, testing, and refining AI-driven workflows.

## Objectives

In this lab, you will perform the following:

- Task 1: Initialize a Prompt Flow Project
- Task 2: Create and Customize Prompts
- Task 3: Develop a Flow with LLM and Prompt Tools

### Task 1: Initialize a Prompt Flow Project

In this task, you will set up a structured environment to manage and streamline prompt-based AI tasks. This involves creating a project directory, configuring essential files and dependencies, and establishing a workflow for designing, testing, and refining prompts. Organizing prompts, data, and evaluation metrics in one place ensures consistency and efficiency, helping you optimize prompt performance and achieve better results with your AI models.

### Task 2: Create and Customize Prompts

In this task, you will focus on creating and customizing prompts by designing targeted and purposeful questions or statements that guide the LLM toward generating accurate and useful responses. You'll define clear objectives, consider the intended audience, and use precise language to ensure relevance. Customization will help align prompts with specific contexts or use cases, improving engagement and effectiveness in applications like education, customer support, and AI-driven workflows.

     >**Note:** If you see an error stating **"Failed to get the connection NotFoundError: Connection Default_AzureOpenAI can't be found in this workspace."** or a similar message, simply ignore it and refresh the page. Your model is already deployed.

1. From the left navigation pane, select **Prompt flow (1)** under **Build and customize** and click **+ Create (2)** to add the Prompt tool to your flow.

   ![](./media/L2T2S6-1911.png)

1. On **Create a new flow** blade, under **Standard flow**, click on **Create (1)**, then enter below provided Folder name **(2)**, and click on **Create (3)**

   ```
   promptflow-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> 
   ```

    >**Note:** **Please make sure to follow the note provided in the same step, just below the screenshot, as it addresses an error you may encounter while creating the Prompt Flow**.

     ![](./media/L2T2S7-1911.png)

      >**Note:** If you encounter permission errors like "Cloud Dependency Permission" or see a "Folder name already exists" message, wait for 5 minutes and then try recreating the prompt flow using a unique name. Sometimes the system may not accept the original name, so try a few different variations until it succeeds. Once the flow is created, rename it to **promptflow-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (2)** by selecting the **edit icon (1)** and clicking on **Save (3)**.

### Task 3: Develop a Flow with LLM and Prompt Tools

In this task, you will develop a flow with Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompt tools by defining a clear objective, selecting the appropriate LLM, and crafting structured prompts to guide the model’s responses. You will iteratively refine these prompts based on the output to ensure accuracy and relevance. Prompt tools will help you manage and optimize the interaction, enabling efficient use of LLMs for tasks such as content creation, data analysis, or automated support.

1. The prompt flow authoring page opens. You can start authoring your flow now. By default, you see a sample flow. This example flow has nodes for the LLM and Python tools.

1. Optionally, you can add more tools to the flow. The visible tool options are **LLM, Prompt, and Python**. 

    ![](./media/4-7-25-l2-13.png)

1. From the **Graph**, select **joke (1)**. Choose an existing connection **ai-modelhub<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>_aoai (2)** from the drop-down menu, and for deployment, select the newly created deployment, **gpt-4.1 (3)**, in the LLM tool editor.

   ![](./media/L2T3S3-1211.png)

1. Scroll up to the **Inputs (1)** section enter any fruit name of your choice like **Apple (2)** in the **Value** field for the topic.

    ![](./media/L2T3S4-1911.png)

1. Select **Save (1)**, and click on **Start compute session (2)**.

    ![](./media/4-7-25-l2-15.png)

   >**Note:** Sometimes, it may take `10–15` minutes for the compute session to start. This delay is due to a portal glitch, so please be patient. There’s no alternative but to wait until the session becomes active. Once the compute session starts, you can see as **Compute session running**

    ![](./media/compute-session-running.png)
    
    
1. Once the compute session is complete, click the **play** button inside the **joke** node to run the **joke node** first, then run the **echo node**.

    ![](./media/L2T3S6-1211.png)

1. Click on the **echo (1)** node from the graph and click on the **Play (2)** button.

    ![](./media/4-7-25-l2-16.png)
  
1. Once both the nodes have successfully executed, select **Run** from the toolbar.

   ![](./media/4-7-25-l2-17.png)

1. Once the flow run is completed, scroll down to the **Outputs** section and select **View full output** to view the flow results. The output will look similar to the image shown below.

     ![](./media/L2T3S9-1911.png)

1. You can view the flow run status and output.

    ![](./media/L2T3S10-1211.png)

    >**Note:** The output may vary as the joke node generates a random joke based on the input topic, which in this case is "Apple". You can experiment with different inputs to see how the output changes.

1. From the top menu, select **+ Prompt (1)** to add the Prompt tool to your flow, give the name of the flow as **modelflow (2)**, and select **Add (3)**.

   ![](./media/gpt-4-demo17.png)

   ![](./media/gpt-4-demo(15).png)

   ```jinja
   Welcome to Joke Bot !
   {% if user_name %}
    Hello, {{ user_name }}!
   {% else %}
    Hello there!
   {% endif %}
