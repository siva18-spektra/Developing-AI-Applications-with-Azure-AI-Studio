# 🚀 Lab 05: Implementing Chat Flow and Tool Integration

#### ⏱️ Estimated Duration: 60 Minutes

## 💡 Lab Scenario

You are a prompt engineer at Contoso Travel, building a conversational travel assistant using Microsoft Foundry. In this lab, you will create a working chat flow connected to a deployed language model, validate it with sample user queries, and publish the flow so it can be consumed as a chat endpoint.

## 🧭 Overview

In this lab, you will be designing and implementing a chat flow to interact with a deployed language model. You will start by creating a basic chat flow using Microsoft Foundry, which includes integrating inputs, an LLM node, and configuring the output to reflect chat responses. You will then test the chat flow, ensure it functions correctly, and deploy it to a production environment.

The final steps involve verifying the deployment, testing the deployed flow with sample queries, and exploring options for integrating the chat flow into applications as a custom copilot.

## 🎯 Objectives

In this lab, you will perform the following:
- Task 1: Design and Implement a Chat Flow
- Task 2: Use LLM and Prompt Tools in Flows
