# Lab 04: Fine-Tuning Prompts for Optimal Performance

#### ⏱️ Estimated Duration: 120 Minutes

## 💡 Lab Scenario

At Contoso, the initial AI system is working, but the quality of responses for complex customer queries could be better. In this lab, you'll take on the role of a prompt engineer, systematically fine-tuning prompts to improve model performance. You'll experiment with different prompt variations, compare results, and measure performance improvements. Finally, you'll optimize the flow for production deployment, ensuring the system can handle real-world customer traffic efficiently and reliably.

## 📘 Overview

In this lab, you will explore fine-tuning prompts for optimal performance, learning how to craft precise and effective input queries that maximize the accuracy, relevance, and efficiency of AI generated responses. 
You will experiment with structuring prompts to guide AI behavior, incorporating context, constraints, and desired output formats to achieve more consistent results. By iterating on prompt design and analyzing AI responses, you will develop best practices for refining inputs to suit various use cases, from summarization and data extraction to creative writing and technical problem-solving.
 
## 🎯 Objectives

In this lab, you will perform the following:
- Task 1: Perform Iterative Prompt Tuning and Variant Comparison
- Task 2: Optimize Flow Performance for Production

### 1️⃣ Task 1: Perform Iterative Prompt Tuning and Variant Comparison 

In this task, you will refine model responses by adjusting prompts over successive iterations. This process enables systematic evaluation and comparison of output variants, helping to ensure that each iteration leads to improved performance and more accurate, relevant responses.

   # system:
   Your task is to classify a given URL into one of the following categories:
   Movie, App, Academic, Channel, Profile, PDF, or None based on the text content information.
   The classification must be based on the URL, the webpage text content summary, or both.
   
   # user:

   Text: The history of the internet dates back to the early 1960s, when the idea of a global network of computers was first proposed. In the late 1960s, the Advanced Research Projects 
   Agency Network (ARPANET) was developed by the United States Department of Defense. It was the first operational packet-switching network and the precursor to the modern internet. The 
   1970s and 1980s saw the development of various protocols and standards, such as TCP/IP, which allowed different networks to communicate with each other. In the 1990s, the invention 
   of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee revolutionized the internet, making it accessible to the general public. Since then, the internet has grown exponentially, becoming an 
   integral part of daily life for billions of people around the world.

1. After you identify which variant is the best by going to the Visualize outputs section, compare the predicted summaries from each variant against the expected summaries using metrics like classification accuracy. Review how closely the AI-generated summaries match the actual ones, and determine which variant performs more consistently. Once the better variant is identified, go back to the flow authoring page, open the summarize_text_content node, click Show variants, and set the best-performing variant as the default for that node.
